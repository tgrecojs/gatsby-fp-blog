To cap this off we will learn how to create our own home-made functor."

# Functors Rd. 1 - A gentle intro.

What more fitting of a way to kick of the posts section of functor.xyz then with a bit on functors! Alright. Let's _contain_ our excitement though - we've got some work to do. ðŸ˜Ž

In this post we're going to learn what requirements must be meant in order for something to be considered a fucntor.

#### "You can't put me in a box"

The essence of a **functor data type** is that it is `mappable`. This simply means that it provides a container (or box) that we can `map()` through in order to transform values.

```
				map(aâ†’b)
[Box of `a`s] ------> [Box of `b`s]
```

Hmmm.... A container that we can map through. ðŸ¤” Sounds kinda familiar, right? Well that's because it is! JavaScript's `Array []` type is a functor. Whether you've realized it or not you have been using functors all along!

##### Testing `map`

Below we see the the functor `a` which is a single element array `[10]`. Our second functor `b` is then created using JavaScript's built-in `Array.prototype.map` method.

```javascript
const doubleIt = x => x * 2;

const functor = [10];
const x = functor.map(doubleIt);
const y = functor.map(x => x * 2);
// testing equality
console.log(x.toString() === y.toString()); // true
```

It's really that simple. If you're a skeptic like me, then you might be having a hard time buying this. Just sit tight though it will all make sense soon.

### Category Theory

Functional Programming is deeply rooted in category theory - here are its basics:

1. **Category**: A collection of objects and arrows between objects.
   - Objects can be anything. \* ex. `[{name: 'Tom', age: 26}]`, `[10,30]`, `['$']`
2. **morphisms**
   - Arrays
   - Example above | ex. `A âˆ’fâ†’ B`

#### Functor Laws:

There two functor laws are:

1. **Identity**:
   - id function must always `map` a functor back to the **same value**,
   - `const id = x => x;`
   - `[1,2,3].map(id); // returns [1,2,3]`
2. **Composition**:
   - Functors of the same type can be computed in any order and it will not effect their value.
   - _Given `g: x => y, f: y => z` where `x,y,z` are collection objects..._ **there must be a composition that directly `X â†’ Z`**.

> This composistion law was the same that I was forced to learn in algebra class. It' **associatve** meaning that the order in which it is computer does not matter. Realizing this was a big "a-ha" moment when studying functional programming.

> **Ex.:** (f â—¦ g) â—¦ h = f â—¦ g â—¦ h = f â—¦ (g â—¦ h)

Now that we know the functor laws lets apply them to another array. Below we have the following:

1. `f` takes an `x` and divides by `.5`
2. `g` takes an `x` and multiplies by `16`
3. `data` is a functor containing 4 values.

```js
const f = x => x / 0.5;
const g = x => x * 16;
const data = [25];

// identity law
console.log(data.toString() === data.map(x => x).toString()); // 25 === 25

// composistion law
console.log(
  functor
    .map(g)
    .map(f)
    .toString() === functor.map(x => f(g(x))).toString()
);
```

##### Who f\*ckin cares dude

Maybe you're not impressed with our `data` array and the one value that it includes. functor's satisfy the `Identity` and `Composistion` law. Well, that's too bad but don't give up just yet.

#### Creating the `Box` functor

We've seen functors in action and we've learned the rules that they must abide by. Now let's create one for ourselves.

The `Box` functor (often referred to as the `Identity` functor) will take a value as it's input. From there, it will return an object `{}` with a `map` method inside of it. When this `map` executes, it will apply it's input `fn` to the value inside and return it's result wrapped inside of. What's that you said? This `map` implementation sure sounds awfully familiar to JavaScript's``Array.prototype.map`. Well, friend, _that's because it is_ !

Taking a look at the code snippet below we see how our `Box` function's `map` method is implemented. Cool, right?

```javascript
const Box = value => ({
  map: fn => Identity(fn(value))
});

const OurFirstFunctor = Box(20);
```

Alright, I get it. Let's extend this a little bit by adding some more methods, `fold` and `inspectValue`.

```javascript
const Box = value => ({
  map: f => Box(f(value)),
  fold: (f, g) => f(value),
  inspectValue: () => `Box${value}`
});
```

```js
// identity law
const id = x => x;

const result = Box(20);

const x1 = result;
const x2 = result.map(id);

x2.map(trace); // value:: 1
x1.map(trace); // value:: 1

// composistion law f(x) * g(x) = f(g(x))
```

### Wrap up

And thus conclude this intro post on functors. Hopefully you've learned something that you didn't prior to reading this.
