It's really that simple. If you're a skeptic like me, then you might be having a hard time buying this. Just sit tight though it will all make sense soon.

### Category Theory

Functional Programming is deeply rooted in category theory - here are its basics:

1. **Category**: A collection of objects and arrows between objects.
   - Objects can be anything. \* ex. `[{name: 'Tom', age: 26}]`, `[10,30]`, `['$']`
2. **morphisms**
   - Arrays
   - Example above | ex. `A −f→ B`
